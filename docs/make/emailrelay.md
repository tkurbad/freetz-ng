Von der Webseite des Herstellers:

> E-MailRelay is a simple SMTP proxy and store-and-forward message
> transfer agent (MTA). When running as a proxy all e-mail messages can
> be passed through a user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which
> can drop, re-address or edit messages as they pass through. When
> running as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages are stored in a
> local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next SMTP server on
> request.
>
> E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server. Messages received over SMTP
> can be automatically dropped into several independent POP3 mailboxes.
