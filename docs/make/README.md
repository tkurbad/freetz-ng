  * **[emailrelay: E-MailRelay 1.9](emailrelay.md)<a id='emailrelay'></a>**<br>
    E-MailRelay is a simple store-and-forward message transfer agent and proxy server. It runs on Unix-like operating systems (including Linux), and on Windows. When used as proxy server the E-MailRelay program (emailrelay) runs in the background and accepts e-mail from local e-mail client programs (KMail, Outlook etc.) or from the outside world, using the SMTP protocol. As soon as an e-mail message is received it is forwarded on to the next SMTP server for onward delivery. This becomes more useful when you add in your own message processing: as each message is received it can be passed one of your programs for editing, filtering, encrypting etc. When used as a store-and-forward transfer agent E-Mail- Relay runs in two modes: the storage daemon part, and the forwarding agent. The storage daemon waits for incoming mail and stores anything it receives in a spool directory. As a forwarding agent E-MailRelay pulls messages out of the	spool directory and passes them on to a remote server -- perhaps your ISP mail server. E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server so that e-mail client programs can read the spooled messages.

    Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a free Unix kernel module that allows non-privileged users to create their own file systems without the need to write any kernel code. This is achieved by running the file systemcode in user space, while the FUSE module only provides a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE was officially merged into the mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14. FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional filesystems which essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing filesystem or storage device. In principle, any resource available to FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system. In Freetz, the NTFS package depends on fuse, for example.

In comparison to most other VM's (free and commercial) it is extremely small, with a stripped executable on PowerPC of only ~160K, and Intel 140K. However, unlike other small VMs (e.g. KVM) it is designed to support the full specification, and includes support for object finalisation, Soft/Weak/Phantom References, class-unloading, the Java Native Interface (JNI) and the Reflection API. Class Libraries: JamVM is designed to use the GNU Classpath Java class library. A number of classes are reference classes which must be modified for a particular VM. These are provided along with JamVM (see INSTALL). JamVM should always work with the latest development snapshot of Classpath (currently 0.93). It should also work with the latest version direct from CVS, and the upcoming 0.94 snapshot (but check the Classpath mailing lists for possible patches). Later snapshots of Classpath may also work, if no modifications have been made to the VM

  * **[Lua 5.1.5 (binary only)](lua.md)<a id='lua'></a>**<br>
    Lua Scripting Language. Lua is a powerful light-weight programming language designed for extending applications. Lua is also frequently used as a general-purpose, stand-alone language. Lua is free software. Lua combines simple procedural syntax with powerful data description constructs based on associative arrays and extensible semantics. Lua is dynamically typed, runs by interpreting bytecode for a register-based virtual machine, and has automatic memory management with incremental garbage collection, making it ideal for configuration, scripting, and rapid prototyping. A fundamental concept in the design of Lua is to provide meta-mechanisms for implementing features, instead of providing a host of features directly in the language. For example, although Lua is not a pure object-oriented language, it does provide meta-mechanisms for implementing classes and inheritance. Lua's meta-mechanisms bring an economy of concepts and keep the language small, while allowing the semantics to be extended in unconventional ways. Extensible semantics is a distinguishing feature of Lua. Lua is a language engine that you can embed into your application. This means that, besides syntax and semantics, Lua has an API that allows the application to exchange data with Lua programs and also to extend Lua with C functions. In this sense, Lua can be regarded as a language framework for building domain-specific languages. Lua is implemented as a small library of C functions, written in ANSI C, and compiles unmodified in all known platforms. The implementation goals are simplicity, efficiency, portability, and low embedding cost. The result is a fast language engine with small footprint, making it ideal in embedded systems too.

  * **<u>nfsroot: NFS-root 0.1</u><a id='nfsroot'></a>**<br>
    Mount a remote filesystem (fs) from an NFS server and use it as a root fs which is fully writable and basically unlimited in size. The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box and during the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on the box is still used, but after the NFS-root is mounted, we pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The read-only fs on the box can still be accessed under /oldroot, but is absolutely not necessary anymore after pivot_root. Having said that, it should be clear that the remote folder to be mounted should contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just create a full copy of a target fs (e.g. from build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image) and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules, executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit the kernel installed on the box. Note: The mini_fo overlay filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was mounted first (see mini_fo package). Still, both packages can be installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root is decativated. Note: This package needs "replace kernel" because a kernel patch is necessary to make the 'nfsroot' bootloader environment variable usable for our purpose. So, if if "replace kernel" is inactive, you will not see this package in

  * **[Screen 4.8.0](screen.md)<a id='screen'></a>**<br>
    Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells), kill the current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of each other.

The way mini_fo is configured here creates the overlay filesystem in the router's RAM disk, so they definitely are *not* reboot-persistent. Nonetheless, mini_fo is tremendously helpful, eliminating the need for tricks like 'mount -o bind' etc. Note: The mini_fo root filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was mounted first (see NFS-root package). Still, both packages can be installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root is decativated. This package does not work with (at least) 7390 at the moment.

  * **[usbroot: USB root 0.2](usbroot.md)<a id='usbroot'></a>**<br>
    Mount an ext{2,3} filesystem (fs) from an USB stick and use it as root fs which may be fully writable and basically unlimited in size. The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box and during the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on the box is still used, but after the USB root is mounted, we pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The default is to unmount the read-only fs on the box to conserve memory, but if desired, it can be still be accessed under /oldroot (though this is absolutely not necessary anymore after pivot_root). Having said that, it should be clear that the usb stick should contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just create a full copy of a target filesystem (e.g. from build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image) and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules, executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit the kernel installed on the box. Note: The webinterface makes it pretty easy to (de-)activate and

  * **[virtualip-cgi: Virtual IP CGI 0.4.2 (deprecated)](virtualip-cgi.md)<a id='virtualip'></a>**<br>

  * **<u>Zabbix 2.4.6 (binary only)</u><a id='zabbix'></a>**<br>
    Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution. Zabbix is software that monitors numerous parameters of a network and the health and integrity of servers. Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure e-mail based alerts for virtually any event. This allows a fast reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent reporting and data visualisation features based on the stored data. This makes Zabbix ideal for capacity planning. Zabbix supports both polling and trapping. All Zabbix reports and statistics, as well as configuration parameters, are accessed through a web-based front end. A web-based front end ensures that the status of your network and the health of your servers can be assessed from any location. Properly configured, Zabbix can play an important role in monitoring IT infrastructure. This is equally true for small organisations with a few servers and for large companies with a multitude of servers. Zabbix is free of cost. Zabbix is written and distributed under the GPL General Public License version 2. It means that its source code is freely distributed and available for the general public.
