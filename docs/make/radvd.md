The router advertisement daemon (RADVD) allows to both Linux and
Windonws clients to obtain an IPv6 IP address, without any changes on
the clients.
More info about RADVD can be found via:

### Request a subnet from SixXS

I hope you have enough points left to request a subnet from SixSX.
If not, make sure you have Aiccu up for a few weeks, see the
[creadits
FAQ](http://www.sixxs.net/faq/account/?faq=credits).

You can request a subnet from your SixXS [home
page](https://www.sixxs.net/home/)
At the left on your home page you should find a list of options from
which you should select [Request
subnet](https://www.sixxs.net/home/requestsubnet/).

### Creating a Feetz Image with Radvd

Follow the directions from the [/wiki/WikiStart.en#
Wiki](../index.en.html#%20Wiki)
After the following step you can configure the packages you want to have
included in your image.

```
make menuconfig
```

Make sure the following is selected:

```
[*] Show advanced options
[*]   Enable IPv6 support
```

```
Package selection  --->  Standard packages  --->  [*] radvd (router advertisement daemon)
```

I also advice to add the following for easier troubleshooting:

```
Advanced options  ---> BusyBox options  --->    IPv6 Options  --->   [*] ping6 command
Advanced options  --->   BusyBox options  --->    IPv6 Options  --->   [*] traceroute6 command
```

#### 'Patching' Freetz-1.2 with Client config option

Due to an application that is not supported on later versions, I prever
to stay on Freetz-1.2.
But due to issues with other IPv6 enabled devices, I would like to
include enhancement Ticket #1921 also in Freetz-1.2.

With the following commands executed before make you can have this
enhancement included also:

```
cd ~/freetz-1.2/make/radvd/files/root/etc/default.radvd/
wget "/browser/trunk/make/radvd/files/root/etc/default.radvd/radvd.cfg?rev=9419&format=txt" -O radvd.cfg
cd ~/freetz-1.2/make/radvd/files/root/etc/default.radvd/
wget "/browser/trunk/make/radvd/files/root/etc/default.radvd/radvd_conf?rev=9453&format=txt" -O radvd_conf
cd ~/freetz-1.2/make/radvd/files/root/usr/lib/cgi-bin/
wget "/browser/trunk/make/radvd/files/root/usr/lib/cgi-bin/radvd.cgi?rev=9444&format=txt" -O radvd.cgi
```

### Setup in Freetz web-interface

In the setup it is 'sufficient' to just configure a /64 from your /48
you received from SixXS. E.g. you can pick the first possilbe /64 range
2001:aaaa:bbbb:0000::/64

Network range - 2001:aaaa:bbbb:0000:0000:0000:0000:0000 -
2001:aaaa:bbbb:0000:ffff:ffff:ffff:ffff

**Note** In below screenshot enhancement Ticket #1921 is
included.

[![Howto setup radvd](../screenshots/236_md.jpg)](../screenshots/236.jpg)

To prevent unexpected reboots I had to unselect the 'Activate on start
resp. deactivate on stop the IPv6 forwarding' on my FB-7270v3.

### Linux Clients

Not much to tell here. The output of ifconfig should show that it
recieved an IPv6 address, starting with your configured subnet and
ending with part of your MAC address in there.

There should also be a default IPv6 route pointing to the IPv6 gateway
(the router).

### WinXP Clients

With my WinXP system I had no problems to obtain an IPv6. All I had to
do was to was to enable IPv6 with:

```
netsh interface ipv6 install
```

Then you should see that you get two IPv6 addresses. One public and a
temporary one.
You can also see them with:

```
netsh interface ipv6 show address
```

### Win7 Clients

I have two Win7 systems. One that was not mutch used with IPv6, and one
where I used AICCU locally as a service at startup.
The one that was not mutch used with IPv6 obtained an IPv6 address
immediately. With the other one it took more effort.
After modifying the service to only startup manually I didn't obtain an
IPv6 address from RADVD, even after a reboot.

If you have a similar problem you can try the following:

-   firt make sure you create a restore point.
-   next use the following commands (note I used both commands without
    verifying correctly which one was needed):

    ``` 
      netsh int ipv6 reset c:ipv6_reset.log
      netsh interface isatap set state enabled
    ```
