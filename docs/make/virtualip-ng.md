# Virtualip-NG - EXPERIMENTAL
  - Package: [master/make/pkgs/virtualip-ng/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/pkgs/virtualip-ng/)
  - Steward: [@ThomasToka](https://github.com/ThomasToka)

This package is based on the original virtualip-cgi script by Daniel Eiband and was rewritten/extended by Thomas Toka

### Overview
Virtualip-NG manages additional virtual IP addresses (IPv4 and IPv6) on AVM/Freetz devices.
It is a rewrite and extension of the former virtualip-cgi module.

### What it does
  - Adds and removes virtual IPv4/IPv6 addresses on configured interfaces.
  - Supports multiple entries in one configuration.
  - Supports per-entry state via active/inactive.
  - Shows a live status table for configured entries in WebUI.
  - Integrates with onlinechanged/WLAN events to re-apply addresses when network state changes.

### IPv6 support
  - IPv6 entries are configured in the same entries list as IPv4.
  - Entry format for IPv6 is:
```
interface,ipv6-address,prefix,active|inactive
```
  - Prefix length is required for IPv6 (for example 64).
  - On add, Virtualip-NG uses `ip -6 addr add <address>/<prefix> dev <interface>`.
  - If IPv6 is disabled on the target interface, Virtualip-NG tries to enable it by writing `0` to `/proc/sys/net/ipv6/conf/<interface>/disable_ipv6` before adding the address.
  - IPv4-only handling like broadcast calculation is not used for IPv6 entries.

### Capabilities
  - Delta reconcile on apply/save:
    - keep unchanged configured active IPs untouched
    - add missing configured active IPs
    - remove configured inactive IPs if present
    - do not touch IPs that are not configured in Virtualip-NG
  - Empty list behavior:
    - no IPs are managed
    - previously known managed IPs are removed on apply
  - Runtime state handling:
    - running only if active configured entries are present on interfaces
    - stopped when no active entries exist or active entries are missing

### Configuration format
The main field is VIRTUALIP_NG_ENTRIES with one entry per line:
```
interface,ip,netmask-or-prefix,active|inactive
```
##### Examples
```
guest,192.168.181.1,255.255.255.0,active
guest,2001:db8:181::2,64,active
lan,192.168.182.1,255.255.255.0,active
lan,fd00::2,64,active
```

### Notes
  - For IPv4, netmask can be dotted (255.255.255.0) or prefix (24).
  - For IPv6, use prefix length (for example 64); dotted netmasks are IPv4-only.
  - Status is mandatory and must be either active or inactive.

### WebUI notes
  - Netzwerkdevices shows current ip a output in a scrollable area.
  - Neu laden refreshes this section on demand.
  - Reload uses the currently active wrapper route and extracts the devices output block from the returned HTML.

### Operational notes
  - Start type (automatic/manual) controls autostart behavior.
  - Entry activity (active/inactive) controls whether each configured IP should be present.
