# Iptables-NG - EXPERIMENTAL
  - Package: [master/make/pkgs/iptables-ng/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/pkgs/iptables-ng/)
  - Steward: [@ThomasToka](https://github.com/ThomasToka)

### Warning
  - This package works only with remove dsld. Without this, routing, pppoe, dns etc are no longer working as intended by AVM.
  - Only IP-client ("Internet mitbenutzen") still works.
  - If you want to know the reason for random reboots with iptables and state/conntrack read the [FAQ](../wiki/00_FAQ/FAQ.de)!

### This package provides an advanced web interface for iptables/ip6tables
  - table and chain discovery (IPv4 + IPv6)
  - module capability hints per table
  - save/restore actions for v4, v6, or both
  - autostart restore via rc.iptables-ng
  - management and optional persistency of ip_forward for network interfaces

### Behavior notes
  - Status (started/stopped) reflects current runtime state only.
  - Automatic/Manual controls startup behavior on boot only.
  - Changing Automatic/Manual does not directly start/stop the module.

### Dependencies and constraints
  - Requires dsld to be disabled/removed (FREETZ_REMOVE_DSLD=y).
  - In menuconfig, this package is selectable only when dsld removal is enabled.
  - You need to use REPLACE_KERNEL in most cases to have a matching Fritzbox Image -> Kernel pair as you need the netfilter modules compiled.

### Chain editor input
You can paste full commands with optional binary prefix, for example:
```
iptables -A INPUT ...
iptables -I INPUT ...
ip6tables -A INPUT ...
-A INPUT ...
-I INPUT ...
-A INPUT ...
```
The edited chain must match the currently opened chain editor section.

### My setup is for example like this
  - Fritzbox in ip client mode: 10.0.0.2
  - Gateway ip 10.0.1.1 on the guest device of the Fritzbox (managed by virtualip-ng *)
  - Fiber router that manages 10.0.0.0/24 on 10.0.0.1
  - Guest vlan on Fritzbox: 10.0.1.0/24
  - Dnsmasq manages dhcp and dns for 10.0.1.0/24 with range 10.0.1.20-10.0.1.200
  - Iptables rules:
```
-P FORWARD ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -d 10.0.0.1/32 -i guest -o lan -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -d 10.0.0.0/24 -i guest -o lan -j DROP
-A FORWARD ! -d 10.0.0.0/24 -i guest -o lan -j ACCEPT
-A FORWARD -d 10.0.1.0/24 -i lan -o guest -m conntrack --ctstate RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
```

### Other
Creator of the package:
This package has been created by Thomas Toka (https://www.github.com/ThomasToka) after a short dive into freetz-ng.

Motivation for this package:
When you use the box in ip-client mode, the guestlan has no dhcp. As i have my internet fiber router on another network i need to forward and encapsulate my traffic from the fritzbox to my router and back.

~~.
This resulted in a PR and the merge of https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/commit/b51f5d82b25da3e63df27df4cc3b3a021d9cd69a allowing to disable dsld -which controls the AVM-Firewall kernel module (kdsldmod)- on newer boxes as the nameing changed some years ago and so the remove dsld patch was broken.
Now its possible to use the full power of iptables on the fritzbox.
All the drama about the "AVM Firwall sometime became a unsolvable iptables breaker" was simply the still running kernel module.
