# Inadyn-mt 02.28.10
 - Package: [master/make/pkgs/inadyn-mt/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/pkgs/inadyn-mt/)

Inadyn is an update client that keeps your IP address up to date at your
DNS name provider.
But also if you have a free Host Service from dyn.com you can use the
update client to update your account within every 30 days to prevent it
from being deleted.
Just using the service is not sufficient to prevent your account from
getting expired.
An update client prevents your account from becoming expired, and also
makes sure a IP address change is updated for your host service.
More info about Inadyn can be found via:
[http://dyn.com/support/clients/linux/](http://dyn.com/support/clients/linux/)
For general update client information you can look here:
[http://dyn.com/support/clients/](http://dyn.com/support/clients/)

It appears from the forum that it is not possible anymore to apply for a
new free account. But on page
[http://dyn.com/legal/account-ownership-and-recovery-policy/](http://dyn.com/legal/account-ownership-and-recovery-policy/)
there is a reference that a new account can be created via
[https://account.dyn.com/entrance/](https://account.dyn.com/entrance/)
Just give it a try.

### Setup in Freetz web-interface

To update your account within the default 30 days you can use the

E.g. for one day you can use 86400 or for 10 days 864000.

If you have enabled the syslog you can verify the syslog messages. E.g.
via a telnet or ssh connection you can using the following command:

```
logread
```

Or via the Freetz web interface: Status > Syslog You can filter on
INADYN to show only Inadyn related messages. You will see that the every
10 minutes by default the IP address is verified for changes. Only if
the IP address changed, your account at your DNS provider is updates
with this new IP address.
