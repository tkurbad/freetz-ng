# Polipo 1.1.1
 - Package: [master/make/pkgs/polipo/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/pkgs/polipo/)

### Using with Tor

1.  Add *socksParentProxy=localhost:9050* to *Additional options*
2.  Point your browser http proxy to 192.168.178.1:8123
3.  Set *No proxy for* to *localhost, 127.0.0.1, 192.168.178.0/24*

(assuming default configuration)

If you use Firefox, use [Tor
Button](https://addons.mozilla.org/nl/firefox/addon/2275/) to
prevent DNS leakage (and other privacy problems with cookies, plugins,
etc).

### Using at your office

Maybe your internet access at your office (school, internet café, etc)
is restricted, filtered and/or monitored and you don't want that. In my
case Trend Micro OfficeScan blocks a lot of web-sites as false positives
(including
[www.ip-phone-forum.de](http://www.ip-phone-forum.de/)).
A solution is this:

1.  Install Polipo and [dropbear](dropbear.md) (or another
    tunnel package)
2.  Forward port 22 (and/or 80 if port 22 is blocked) to localhost:22
    using [AVM-firewall](avm-firewall.md)
3.  Create an [SSH
    tunnel](http://oldsite.precedence.co.uk/nc/putty.html)
    from your office to your FritzBox, for example using
    [putty](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/)
4.  Configure your browser at your office to use the http proxy
    localhost:8123 (assuming default Polipo configuration)

It is not an bad idea to restrict the memory Polipo will use with the
following additional option:

```
chunkHighMark=1048576
```

### Security

Unless you restrict the IP addresses that can access dropbear, my advice
is to disable password login and to use [host-based
authentication](dropbear.html#ZugangmitPutty1).

It is also possible to encapsulate SSH traffic using
[STunnel](stunnel.md), for cases where only http/https traffic
is allowed.

Beware that DNS requests could still be monitored, see the section about
Tor about how to prevent this. (it is possible to use Tor Button without
Tor)

It is possible to tighten security by using these options:

```
tunnelAllowedPorts=443;allowedPorts=80,443
```

This prevent tunneling through the proxy and access to the freetz web
interface.

### Blocking domains

Using the extra options it is possible to specify a file with forbidden
domains, like this:

```
forbiddenFile=/var/media/ftp/uFlash/polipo/forbidden
```

Add the domains you want to block on separate lines, like this:

```
doubleclick.net
googleadservices.com
google-analytics.com
googlesyndication.com
facebook.com/plugins
```
