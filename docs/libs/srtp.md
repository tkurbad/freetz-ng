SRTP is a security profile for RTP that adds confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to that protocol. It is specified in RFC 3711. LibSRTP provides an implementation of the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), the Universal Security Transform (UST), and a supporting cryptographic kernel.
