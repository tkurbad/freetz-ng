libevent is an asynchronous event notification software library. The libevent API provides a mechanism to execute a callback function when a specific event occurs on a file descriptor or after a timeout has been reached. Furthermore, libevent also support callbacks due to signals or regular timeouts. libevent is meant to replace the event loop found in event-driven network servers. An application just needs to call event_dispatch() and then add or remove events dynamically without having to change the event loop.
