### R

  * **[readline: libreadline (libreadline.so) 8.2](readline.md)<a id='readline'></a>**<br>
    The Readline library provides a set of functions for use by applications that allow users to edit command lines as they are typed in. Both Emacs and vi editing modes are available. The Readline library includes additional functions to maintain a list of previously-entered command lines, to recall and perhaps reedit those lines, and perform csh-like history expansion on previous commands.

### S

    High-performance asynchronous HTTP client library

  * **[spandsp: libspandsp (libspandsp.so) 0.0.6](spandsp.md)<a id='spandsp'></a>**<br>
    SpanDSP is a library of DSP functions for telephony, in the 8000 sample per second world of E1s, T1s, and higher order PCM channels. It contains low level functions, such as basic filters. It also contains higher level functions, such as cadenced supervisory tone detection, and a complete software FAX machine.

  * **[speex: libspeex (libspeex.so) 1.2rc1](speex.md)<a id='speex'></a>**<br>
    Speex is an Open Source/Free Software patent-free audio compression format designed for speech. This package contains the shared codec library.

  * **[srtp: libsrtp (libsrtp.so) 1.4.4](srtp.md)<a id='srtp'></a>**<br>
    SRTP is a security profile for RTP that adds confidentiality, message authentication, and replay protection to that protocol. It is specified in RFC 3711. LibSRTP provides an implementation of the Secure Real-Time Transport Protocol (SRTP), the Universal Security Transform (UST), and a supporting cryptographic kernel.

  * **[sysfsutils: libsysfs (libsysfs.so) 2.1.0](sysfsutils.md)<a id='sysfsutils'></a>**<br>

### T

  * **[taglib (libtag.so) 1.6.3](taglib.md)<a id='taglib'></a>**<br>
    TagLib is a library for reading and editing the meta-data of several popular audio formats. Currently it supports both ID3v1 and ID3v2 for MP3 files, Ogg Vorbis comments and ID3 tags and Vorbis comments in FLAC, MPC, Speex, WavPack TrueAudio, WAV, AIFF, MP4 and ASF files.

### U

  * **[uClibc (ld-uClibc-x.y.z.so) 0.9.28/0.9.29/0.9.32.1/0.9.33.2/1.0.14/1.0.44](uclibc.md)<a id='uclibc'></a>**<br>
    uClibc is a small C standard library intended for embedded Linux systems. uClibc was created to support uClinux, a version of Linux not requiring a memory management unit and thus suited for microcontrollers (hence the "uC" in the name - "u" is a replacement for the Greek character "miu" often used as an abbreviation for the prefix "micro"). uClibc is much smaller than GNU C Library (glibc), the C library normally used with Linux distributions. While glibc is intended to fully support all relevant C standards across a wide range of platforms, uClibc is specifically focused on embedded Linux. Features can be enabled or disabled according to space requirements.

  * **[uclibcxx: uClibc++ (libuClibc++.so.0.2.5) 2b58f77ee27c60842054fd0e5dd67f5d00e89eb8](uclibcxx.md)<a id='uclibcxx'></a>**<br>
    An implementation of the Standard C++ Library optimized for embedded systems.

  * **[udns: libudns (libudns.so) 0.4](udns.md)<a id='udns'></a>**<br>
    UDNS is a stub DNS resolver library with ability to perform both syncronous and asyncronous DNS queries.
