# libavmhmac (libavmhmac.so) - EXPERIMENTAL 0.2
 - Library: [master/make/libs/libavmhmac/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/libavmhmac/)

Replaces AVM's libavmhmac. Our libavmhmac only forwards functions to openssl's libcrypto where AVM wrote their own implementations. We have no clue why they did this.
