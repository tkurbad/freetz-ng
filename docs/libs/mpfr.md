# mpfr: GNU MPFR Library (libmpfr.so) 3.1.6
 - Library: [master/make/libs/mpfr/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/mpfr/)

MPFR provides a library for multiple-precision floating-point computation with correct rounding. The computation is both efficient and has a well-defined semantics. It copies the good ideas from the ANSI/IEEE-754 standard for double-precision floating-point arithmetic (53-bit mantissa).
