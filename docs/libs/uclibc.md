# uclibc: ld-uClibc (ld-uClibc-x.y.z.so)
 - Library: [master/make/libs/uclibc/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/uclibc/)

uClibc is a small C standard library intended for embedded Linux systems. uClibc was created to support uClinux, a version of Linux not requiring a memory management unit and thus suited for microcontrollers (hence the "uC" in the name - "u" is a replacement for the Greek character "miu" often used as an abbreviation for the prefix "micro"). uClibc is much smaller than GNU C Library (glibc), the C library normally used with Linux distributions. While glibc is intended to fully support all relevant C standards across a wide range of platforms, uClibc is specifically focused on embedded Linux. Features can be enabled or disabled according to space requirements.
