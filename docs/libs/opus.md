Opus is a totally open, royalty-free, highly versatile audio codec. It is primarily designed for interactive speech and music transmission over the Internet, but is also applicable to storage and streaming applications. It incorporates technology from Skype's SILK codec and Xiph.Org's CELT codec. It has been standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) as RFC 6716.
