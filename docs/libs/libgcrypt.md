Libgcrypt is a general-purpose cryptographic library based on the code from GnuPG. It provides functions for all cryptographic building blocks: symmetric ciphers (AES, DES, Blowfish, CAST5, Twofish, and Arcfour), hash algorithms (MD4, MD5, RIPE-MD160, SHA-1, and TIGER-192), MACs (HMAC for all hash algorithms), public key algorithms (RSA, ElGamal, and DSA), large integer functions, random numbers, and a lot of supporting functions.
