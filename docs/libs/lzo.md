 - Library: [master/make/libs/lzo/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/lzo/)

LZO is a portable lossless data compression library written in ANSI C. It offers pretty fast compression and *very* fast decompression. Decompression requires no memory. In addition there are slower compression levels achieving a quite competitive compression ratio while still decompressing at this very high speed.
