# libconfig (libconfig.so) 1.5
 - Library: [master/make/libs/libconfig/](https://github.com/Freetz-NG/freetz-ng/tree/master/make/libs/libconfig/)

Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration files. Libconfig is very compact - just 46K for the stripped C shared library. This makes it well-suited for memory-constrained systems.
