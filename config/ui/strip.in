		bool "Strip leftover unstripped binaries/libraries"
		default y
		help
			This option shrinks unstripped binaries/libraries via fwmod script.
			In case of problems, you can disable it (Default: enabled).

	config FREETZ_STRIP_LIBRARIES
		bool "Run mklibs on the built root filesystem - EXPERIMENTAL"
		depends on !FREETZ_SEPARATE_AVM_UCLIBC
		default n
		help
			Recompiles all the shared libraries to only include the
			symbols actually needed to run the binaries on the target.

			Note that this will make the system libraries incompatible
			with most of the packages that are not selected during the
			build process.

				Disables shrinking of modules.

			help
				Shrinks modules added by Freetz only.

		config FREETZ_STRIP_MODULES_ALL
			bool "Freetz & AVM - EXPERIMENTAL"
			help
				Shrinks all modules. May cause weird effects, like
				all LEDs flashing. See https://trac.boxmatrix.info/freetz-ng/ticket/1249

	config FREETZ_STRIP_SCRIPTS
		bool "Strip comments from shell scripts - EXPERIMENTAL"
		default n
		help
			Shrinks shell scripts by removing comments and whitespace. Saves up to
			37K (compressed), depending on firmware and package selection.

			DO NOT USE this option unless you absolutely have to because you are in
			desparate need for some more space in your firmware image. This mostly
			applies to hardware with just 4 MB flash memory, maybe 8 MB in some cases.

			ATTENTION: This option has a runtime of 1 minute!

			CAVEAT: The stripping code is a simple heuristic, so theoretically there
			could be problems caused by mutilated scripts (unlikely, but possible).
			In case of strange firmware behaviour you might want to disable this patch
			and retry to see if that fixes the problem. If so, please report to the
			Freetz team.
