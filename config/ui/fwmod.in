			In 99,9% of all cases you want this option deactivated because usually

			Keep this enabled to check the signature of the image
			file with AVM's device specific public key.
			Some very old devices have no signed firmware yet.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_MODIFY
		bool "Skip modifying unpacked firmware, adding Freetz stuff"
		default n

			Usually you want this option deactivated, but maybe you want to use
			the Freetz build infrastructure to build your own custom firmware mod
			without actually adding any Freetz-specific stuff. If so, activate
			this option.

	config FREETZ_FWMOD_SKIP_PACK
		bool "Skip packing modified firmware"
		default n
		help
			If you are a USB root or NFS root user, you probably do not need a
			packed firmware image for flashing. It might not fit into the box's
			flash memory anyway if you have chosen a lot of packages. In that
			case you want to activate this option.

			The firmware image will be signed with a self created key.
			It can only be flashed by bootloader or with Freetz.
			In case the installed firmware contains already your public
			signature key, you could also flash it by AVM web interface.

				A password with at least 6 characters is required. It could
				be set here or will be read from command line during make.
				If you have forgotten the password, you could delete the
				 ~/.freetz-signature/ directory to create a new key file set.

				As ~/.freetz-signature/ is used by all you Freetz checkouts,
				you need to use for all the same password! Or you link/create
				./.signature/ directory by yourself.

			Choose this option if you intend to use the packed image on an SDK
			stick (see https://web.archive.org/20200701000000/wehavemorefun.de/fritzbox/SDK-Firmware).
			At the time of writing this, SDK stick mode is only supported on
			7270_v2/3, but maybe you found a way to port it to another firmware,

		help
			Choose this option if you intend to use the modified file system as a
			USB root and want it packed into a .tar.gz archive for later transfer
			to the USB medium.

			This option can also be useful for NFS root, if you want to archive
			the file system in addition to or instead of copying it to a target
			directory directly using the next option.

			Choose this option if you intend to use the modified file system as
			an NFS root and want it copied to a target folder of your choice.

			This option can also be useful for USB root, if the target USB medium
			is already attached to your workstation or accessible via NFS (*not*
			Samba/CIFS!).

			ATTENTION: Make sure that the target folder is *not* mounted as a
			USB/NFS root while copying files into it. This would probably cause
			your box to reboot and lead to an inconsistent root file system.
			You should also be aware of the fact that in order to cleanly unpack
			file root system to the target folder we need to be root (fakeroot is
			enough to pack, but not to unpack). So please be ready to enter your
			user password for sudo.

			Enter the target folder name here. It can be either absolute or
			relative to the Freetz build system's base directory (where e.g.
			fwmod is located).
