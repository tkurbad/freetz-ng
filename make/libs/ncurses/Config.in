		ncurses is a programming library providing an API, allowing the
		programmer to write text user interfaces in a terminal-independent
		manner. It also optimizes screen changes, in order to reduce the
		latency experienced when using remote shells.

		Ncurses stands for "new curses", and is a replacement for the
		discontinued 4.4 BSD classic curses.

config FREETZ_LIB_libform
	bool "libform (libform.so)"
	default n
	help
		The form library is a curses extension that supports easy programming of
		on-screen forms for data entry and program control.

config FREETZ_LIB_libmenu
	bool "libmenu (libmenu.so)"
	default n
	help
		The menu library is a curses extension that supports easy programming of
		menu hierarchies with a uniform but flexible interface.

config FREETZ_LIB_libpanel
	bool "libpanel (libpanel.so)"
	default n
	help
		The ncurses library by itself provides good support for screen displays
		in which the windows are tiled (non-overlapping).
		When your interface design is such that windows may dive deeper into
		the visibility stack or pop to the top at runtime, the resulting book-
		keeping can be tedious and difficult to get right. Hence the panels
		library.
