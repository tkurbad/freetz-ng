		Pango is a library for layout and rendering of text, with an emphasis
		on internationalization. Pango can be used anywhere that text layout
		is needed; however, most of the work on Pango so far has been done using
		the GTK widget toolkit as a test platform. Pango forms the core of text
		and font handling for GTK.
