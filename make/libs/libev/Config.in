		libev provides a full-featured and high-performance event loop
		that is loosely modelled after libevent. It includes relative timers,
		absolute timers with customized rescheduling, synchronous signals,
		process status change events, event watchers dealing with the event
		loop itself, file watchers, and even limited support for fork events.
		It uses a priority queue to manage timers and uses arrays as fundamental
		data structure. It has no artificial limitations on the number
		of watchers waiting for the same event.
