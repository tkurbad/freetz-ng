		The libcap-ng library should make programming with posix capabilities
		easier. The library has some utilities to help you analyse a system
		for apps that may have too much privileges.

	help
		This library can be used via LD_PRELOAD to force an application
		started with ambient capabilities to drop them. It leaves other
		capabilities intact. This can also be linked against and
		automatically does the right thing. You do not need to make any
		calls into the library because all the work is done in the
		constructor which runs before main() is called.
