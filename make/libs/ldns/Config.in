		The goal of ldns is to simplify DNS programming, it supports recent RFCs
		like the DNSSEC documents, and allows developers to easily create software
		conforming to current RFCs, and experimental software for current Internet
		Drafts. A secondary benefit of using ldns is speed; ldns is written in C
		it should be a lot faster than Perl.
