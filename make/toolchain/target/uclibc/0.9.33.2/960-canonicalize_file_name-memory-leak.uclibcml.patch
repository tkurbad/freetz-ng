Subject: [PATCH]libc/stdlib: canonicalize_file_name() memory leak
Date: Wed, 21 Oct 2015 06:02:30 +0000 (UTC)

System based on Buildroot 2014.11
    Linux 3.10.88
    uclibc 0.9.33.2 (also with 1.0.2)
    systemd 216
    gcc 4.8.3 (also with 4.9.2)

Bug:
    After 2 days system is out of memory. PID 1 (systemd) is allocating.
    over 120MB od RAM..
    Just after reboot PID 1 is taking only about 600kB.

How to reproduce:
    With every systemd service reload or restart, heap of PID 1 grows.
    Try with command:
    watch -n1 \
    'systemctl stop systemd-sysctl ; grep heap /proc/1/smaps -A15; free'

Source of bug:

    Uclibc's canonicalize_file_name() is allocating temprary buffer of.
    4kB (PATH_MAX), and passing it to realpath() as second argument..
    Function canonicalize... is not checking if realpath() fails and.
    memory is lost.

    Backtrace:
    #0  malloc (bytes=4096) at libc/stdlib/malloc-standard/malloc.c:844
    #1  canonicalize_file_name.
        (name="/etc/systemd/system/systemd-sysctl.service.d") at.
        libc/stdlib/canonicalize.c:30
    #2  path_strv_resolve (...) at src/shared/path-util.c:275

Solution:
    Do not use temporary buffer like in eglibc.
    Function realpath() will be responsible for allocation.

Uclibc's canonicalize_file_name() is allocating temprary buffer of 4kB
(PATH_MAX), and passing it to realpath() as second argument. Function is
not checking if realpath() fails and memory is lost.
