		Endlessh is an SSH tarpit that very slowly sends an endless, 
		random SSH banner. It keeps SSH clients locked up for hours 
		or even days at a time. The purpose is to put your real 
		SSH server on another port and then let the script kiddies 
		get stuck in this tarpit instead of bothering a real server.
