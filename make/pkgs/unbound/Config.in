			unbound - Unbound DNS validating resolver
			
			It  uses a built in list of authoritative nameservers for the root zone
			(.), the so called root hints.  On receiving a DNS query  it  will  ask
			the root nameservers for an answer and will in almost all cases receive
			a delegation to a top level domain (TLD) authoritative nameserver.   It
			will  then ask that nameserver for an answer.  It will recursively con-
			tinue until an answer is found or no answer  is  available  (NXDOMAIN).
			For performance and efficiency reasons that answer is cached for a cer-
			tain time (the answer's time-to-live or TTL).  A second query  for  the
			same  name  will  then be answered from the cache.  Unbound can also do
			DNSSEC validation.
