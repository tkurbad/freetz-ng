		XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression format,
		which provides memory-hungry but powerful compression (often better than bzip2)
		and fast, easy decompression.

		This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ compression.
		They can also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
		symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma package.
