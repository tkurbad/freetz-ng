		XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm compression format,
		which provides memory-hungry but powerful compression (often better than bzip2)
		and fast, easy decompression.

		The native format of liblzma is XZ; it also supports raw (headerless) streams
		and the older LZMA format used by lzma.
