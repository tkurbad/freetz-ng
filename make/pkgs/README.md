  * **[emailrelay: E-MailRelay 1.9](../../docs/make/emailrelay.md)<a id='emailrelay'></a>**<br>
    E-MailRelay is a simple store-and-forward message transfer agent and proxy server. It runs on Unix-like operating systems (including Linux), and on Windows. When used as proxy server the E-MailRelay program (emailrelay) runs in the background and accepts e-mail from local e-mail client programs (KMail, Outlook etc.) or from the outside world, using the SMTP protocol. As soon as an e-mail message is received it is forwarded on to the next SMTP server for onward delivery. This becomes more useful when you add in your own message processing: as each message is received it can be passed one of your programs for editing, filtering, encrypting etc. When used as a store-and-forward transfer agent E-Mail- Relay runs in two modes: the storage daemon part, and the forwarding agent. The storage daemon waits for incoming mail and stores anything it receives in a spool directory. As a forwarding agent E-MailRelay pulls messages out of the	spool directory and passes them on to a remote server -- perhaps your ISP mail server.

    Filesystem in Userspace (FUSE) is a free Unix kernel module that allows non-privileged users to create their own file systems without the need to write any kernel code. This is achieved by running the file systemcode in user space, while the FUSE module only provides a "bridge" to the actual kernel interfaces. FUSE was officially merged into the mainstream Linux kernel tree in kernel version 2.6.14. FUSE is particularly useful for writing virtual file systems. Unlike traditional filesystems which essentially save data to and retrieve data from disk, virtual filesystems do not actually store data themselves. They act as a view or translation of an existing filesystem or storage device. In principle, any resource available to FUSE implementation can be exported as a file system. In Freetz, the NTFS package depends on fuse, for example.

The program was designed with an emphasis on usability, and it does as much as it can for you automatically so you can do what you expect to do with a file transfer program, which is transfer files between two interconnected systems.

  * **<u>nfsroot: NFS-root 0.1</u><a id='nfsroot'></a>**<br>
    Mount a remote filesystem (fs) from an NFS server and use it as a root fs which is fully writable and basically unlimited in size. The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box and during the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on the box is still used, but after the NFS-root is mounted, we pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The read-only fs on the box can still be accessed under /oldroot, but is absolutely not necessary anymore after pivot_root. Having said that, it should be clear that the remote folder to be mounted should contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just create a full copy of a target fs (e.g. from build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image) and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules, executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit the kernel installed on the box. Note: The mini_fo overlay filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was mounted first (see mini_fo package). Still, both packages can be installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root is decativated. Note: This package needs "replace kernel" because a kernel patch is necessary to make the 'nfsroot' bootloader environment variable usable for our purpose. So, if if "replace kernel" is inactive, you will not see this package in menuconfig. Note: There currently is no web interface for this package, because an NFS-root is an expert thing anyway. The command-line interface and help screen of /etc/init.d/rc.nfs makes it pretty easy to (de-)activate and configure the functionality of this package. As configuration data are stored in bootloader environment rather than in TFFS like for other packages, this package is special anyway.

  * **[Nmap 4.76/5.51/7.94 (binary only)](../../docs/make/nmap.md)<a id='nmap'></a>**<br>
    Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network exploration or security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services (application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems (and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer operating systems, and both console and graphical versions are available.

  * **[Screen 4.9.1](../../docs/make/screen.md)<a id='screen'></a>**<br>
    Screen is a full-screen window manager that multiplexes a physical terminal between several processes, typically interactive shells. Each virtual terminal provides the functions of the DEC VT100 terminal and, in addition, several control functions from the ANSI X3.64 (ISO 6429) and ISO 2022 standards (e.g., insert/delete line and support for multiple character sets). There is a scrollback history buffer for each virtual terminal and a copy-and-paste mechanism that allows the user to move text regions between windows. When screen is called, it creates a single window with a shell in it (or the specified command) and then gets out of your way so that you can use the program as you normally would. Then, at any time, you can create new (full-screen) windows with other programs in them (including more shells), kill the current window, view a list of the active windows, turn output logging on and off, copy text between windows, view the scrollback history, switch between windows, etc. All windows run their programs completely independent of each other. Programs continue to run when their window is currently not visible and even when the whole screen session is detached from the users terminal.

    hp-utils is a collection of utility programs for HP printers. It's meant to be used on systems, which are unable to run the corresponding programs provided by HPLIP, e.g. because they only have limited memory and/or cpu power. hp-utils is primarily focused towards embedded systems, particularly towards the FRITZ!Box, a family of DSL routers produced by AVM.

  * **[Iptables 1.4.11.1/1.4.21/1.6.2 (binary only)](../../docs/make/iptables.md)<a id='iptables'></a>**<br>
    Netfilter/iptables Netfilter is the set of hooks within the Linux kernel for intercepting and manipulating network packets. The best-known component on top of netfilter is the firewall which filters packets, but the hooks are also used by a component which performs network address translation, and by another which provides ipchains backwards compatibility. These components are usually Loadable Kernel Modules. iptables is the name of the user space tool by which administrators create rules for the packet filtering and NAT modules. While technically iptables is merely the tool which controls the packet filtering and NAT components within the kernel, the name iptables is often used to refer to the entire infrastructure, including netfilter, connection tracking and NAT, as well as the tool itself. iptables is a standard part of all modern Linux distributions.

  * **[mini_fo 0.3](../../docs/make/mini_fo.md)<a id='mini-fo'></a>**<br>
    Makes the filesystem writeable. Changes are not reboot-persistent, unless stored on a hard disk or on flash storage media. The way mini_fo is configured here creates the overlay filesystem in the router's RAM disk, so they definitely are *not* reboot-persistent. Nonetheless, mini_fo is tremendously helpful, eliminating the need for tricks like 'mount -o bind' etc. Note: The mini_fo root filesystem will not be used if an NFS-root was mounted first (see NFS-root package). Still, both packages can be installed at the same time, because mini_fo is still useful if NFS-root is decativated. This package does not work with (at least) 7390 at the moment.

    USB/IP Project aims to develop a general USB device sharing system over IP network. To share USB devices between computers with their full functionality, USB/IP encapsulates "USB I/O messages" into IP packets and transmits them between computers. If you plan to share a printer with this package, consider to remove AVM's printserv, but not the usblp kernel module.

  * **[usbroot: USB root 0.2](../../docs/make/usbroot.md)<a id='usbroot'></a>**<br>
    Mount an ext{2,3} filesystem (fs) from an USB stick and use it as root fs which may be fully writable and basically unlimited in size. The Linux kernel will still be loaded from your box and during the first phase of the init process the SquashFS on the box is still used, but after the USB root is mounted, we pivot_root into it and it becomes the new root fs. The default is to unmount the read-only fs on the box to conserve memory, but if desired, it can be still be accessed under /oldroot (though this is absolutely not necessary anymore after pivot_root). Having said that, it should be clear that the usb stick should contain everything necessary to run the box. Usually you just create a full copy of a target filesystem (e.g. from build/modified/filesystem or from an unpacked firmware image) and start modifying it as needed. The binaries (kernel modules, executables, shared libraries) used therein just have to fit the kernel installed on the box. Note: The webinterface makes it pretty easy to (de-)activate and configure the functionality of this package. However, USB root is an expert thing! See also the help screen of /etc/init.d/rc.usbroot for further description. As some config data is stored in bootloader environment, this package is special anyway.

  * **<u>Zabbix 2.4.6 (binary only)</u><a id='zabbix'></a>**<br>
    Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring solution. Zabbix is software that monitors numerous parameters of a network and the health and integrity of servers. Zabbix uses a flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure e-mail based alerts for virtually any event. This allows a fast reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent reporting and data visualisation features based on the stored data. This makes Zabbix ideal for capacity planning. Zabbix supports both polling and trapping. All Zabbix reports and statistics, as well as configuration parameters, are accessed through a web-based front end. A web-based front end ensures that the status of your network and the health of your servers can be assessed from any location. Properly configured, Zabbix can play an important role in monitoring IT infrastructure. This is equally true for small organisations with a few servers and for large companies with a multitude of servers. Zabbix is free of cost. Zabbix is written and distributed under the GPL General Public License version 2. It means that its source code is freely distributed and available for the general public.
