		ftdi_eeprom of libftdi1
		is a small tool for reading/erasing/flashing FTDI USB chip eeproms.
		It uses libftdi1 to access the chip, so you will need to have the
		required permissions on the device. The ftdi_sio module should not
		be loaded. You have to unplug and replug your device to get the new
		values to be read. Otherwise, you will still get the old values.
