		E-MailRelay is a simple store-and-forward message
		transfer agent and proxy server. It runs on Unix-like
		operating systems (including Linux), and on Windows.

		When used as proxy server the E-MailRelay program
		(emailrelay) runs in the background and accepts e-mail
		from local e-mail client programs (KMail, Outlook etc.)
		or from the outside world, using the SMTP protocol. As
		soon as an e-mail message is received it is forwarded
		on to the next SMTP server for onward delivery. This
		becomes more useful when you add in your own message
		processing: as each message is received it can be passed
		one of your programs for editing, filtering, encrypting etc.

		When used as a store-and-forward transfer agent E-Mail-
		Relay runs in two modes: the storage daemon part, and the
		forwarding agent. The storage daemon waits for incoming
		mail and stores anything it receives in a spool directory.
		As a forwarding agent E-MailRelay pulls messages out
		of the	spool directory and passes them on to a remote
		server -- perhaps your ISP mail server.
		E-MailRelay can also run as a POP3 server so that e-mail
		client programs can read the spooled messages.
