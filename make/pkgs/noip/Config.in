		This is No-IP.com's dynamic DNS update client. When configured correctly,
		the client will check the local IP address at a given time interval for
		any changes. If the local IP address has changed it will notify the DNS
		servers at No-IP.com and update the IP corresponding to your No-IP/No-IP+
		hostname.
