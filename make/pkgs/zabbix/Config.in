		Zabbix is an enterprise-class open source distributed monitoring
		solution.

		Zabbix is software that monitors numerous parameters of a
		network and the health and integrity of servers. Zabbix uses a
		flexible notification mechanism that allows users to configure
		e-mail based alerts for virtually any event. This allows a fast
		reaction to server problems. Zabbix offers excellent reporting
		and data visualisation features based on the stored data. This
		makes Zabbix ideal for capacity planning.

		Zabbix supports both polling and trapping. All Zabbix reports
		and statistics, as well as configuration parameters, are
		accessed through a web-based front end. A web-based front end
		ensures that the status of your network and the health of your
		servers can be assessed from any location. Properly configured,
		Zabbix can play an important role in monitoring IT
		infrastructure. This is equally true for small organisations
		with a few servers and for large companies with a multitude of
		servers.

		Zabbix is free of cost. Zabbix is written and distributed under
		the GPL General Public License version 2. It means that
		its source code is freely distributed and available for the
		general public.

		Zabbix agent is deployed on a monitoring target to actively
		monitor local resources and applications (hard drives, memory,
		processor statistics etc).

		The agent gathers operational information locally and reports
		data to Zabbix server for further processing. In case of failures
		(such as a hard disk running full or a crashed service process),
		Zabbix server can actively alert the administrators of the particular
		machine that reported the failure.

		Zabbix server is the central process of Zabbix software.
		The server performs the polling and trapping of data,
		it calculates triggers, sends notifications to users.
		It is the central component to which Zabbix agents and
		proxies report data on availability and integrity of systems.
		The server can itself remotely check networked services
		(such as web servers and mail servers) using simple service checks.

		Note: most freetz users want to say NO here.

	help
		Zabbix proxy is a process that may collect monitoring data
		from one or more monitored devices and send the information
		to the Zabbix server, essentially working on behalf of the server.
		All collected data is buffered locally and then transferred
		to the Zabbix server the proxy belongs to.

		Deploying a proxy is optional, but may be very beneficial
		to distribute the load of a single Zabbix server. If only
		proxies collect data, processing on the server becomes
		less CPU and disk I/O hungry.

	help
		Zabbix sender is a command line utility that may be used
		to send performance data to Zabbix server for processing.

		The utility is usually used in long running user scripts
		for periodical sending of availability and performance data.

config FREETZ_PACKAGE_ZABBIX_get
	bool "get"
	depends on FREETZ_PACKAGE_ZABBIX

	default n
	help
		Zabbix get is a process which can be used to communicate
		with Zabbix agent and retrieve required information from
		the agent.

		The utility is usually used for the troubleshooting
		of Zabbix agents.
