		JamVM - extremely small Java VM

		JamVM 2.0.0 is the first release of JamVM with support for OpenJDK.  Although
		IcedTea already includes JamVM with OpenJDK support, this has been based on
		periodic snapshots of the development tree.

		This release supports OpenJDK 6, 7 and 8 (the latest).  With OpenJDK 7 and 8
		this includes full support for JSR 292 (invokedynamic).  JamVM 2.0.0
		with OpenJDK 8 also includes full support for Lambda expressions (JSR 335),
		type annotations (JSR 308) and method parameter reflection.

		In addition to OpenJDK support, JamVM 2.0.0 also includes many bug-fixes,
		performance improvements and improved compatibility (from running the OpenJDK
		jtreg tests).  The following is an edited list of the top ~100 commits (out
		of 300+) in date order (most recent first).  The list has been categorised
		into those affecting OpenJDK only, GNU Classpath only, and both OpenJDK and
		GNU Classpath (All).
