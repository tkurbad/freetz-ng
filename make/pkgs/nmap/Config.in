		Nmap ("Network Mapper") is a free and open source (license) utility for network
		exploration or security auditing. Many systems and network administrators also
		find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, managing service upgrade
		schedules, and monitoring host or service uptime. Nmap uses raw IP packets in
		novel ways to determine what hosts are available on the network, what services
		(application name and version) those hosts are offering, what operating systems
		(and OS versions) they are running, what type of packet filters/firewalls are in
		use, and dozens of other characteristics. It was designed to rapidly scan large
		networks, but works fine against single hosts. Nmap runs on all major computer
		operating systems, and both console and graphical versions are available.
